# SDL_Physics_System

SDL Physics Simulator is a comprehensive physics simulation game developed in C++ using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library. This game showcases a robust implementation of physics principles, such as the simulation of friction, and custom collision detection. A state machine is used to manage the game logic, demonstrating a solid understanding of game design principles.

# Features

Friction Simulation: The game accurately simulates friction, providing a realistic experience when objects interact in the game world.

Custom Collision Detection: A custom collision detection system is implemented to handle interactions between objects, enhancing the realism of the physics simulation.

State Machine Logic: The game logic is managed using a state machine, providing a structured and efficient approach to controlling game states and transitions.
